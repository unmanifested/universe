Universe:
-We live in a self created and is unfolding as we look deeper
-Our imagination is the mind of God
-The universe is a simulation
    
'The animation of forces driving us to bring the unmanifested into this world
From soul, heart, and mind, arise imagination, memory, and purpose
This is what makes us human, the creators of benevolent technologies'
