    def see(self):
        ''' The predominate perception to guide our world view: millions of
            neurons feeding directly into the occipital lobe capturing a tiny
            fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum painting a colorful
            (and extremely useful) rendering of an external universe within
            our minds.'''


    def smell(self):
        ''' There are over four hundred different types of olfactory receptors,
            all of which have different variants and are uniquely nuanced
            between individuals. All scent perception is a mathematically
            distinct experience for every being. Yet we largely agree that our
            own versions of the perception can be called the same thing, ie.

    def hear(self):
        ''' The purveyor of good vibrations. Pressure differentials vibrate tiny
            bone structures which in turn bang on the outside of a fluid filled 
            sac impregnated by hairs which translate the sonic universe into a
            language our brains understand.'''
    
    def touch(self):
        ''' Our skin, acting as a barrier to the external, informs us of what is
            going on out-there, and our brains listen attentively with plentiful
            resources dedicated to receiving and interpreting these important
            messages.'''
    
    def proprioceive(self):
        ''' The act of perceiving kinesthesia or the act of proprioception... I
            had to make this word up since I couldn't find a verb to express
            this type of perception, but it is essentially our bodies' awareness
            of itself.'''
