class SensoryNeuron(Neuron):
    ''' The body gives us access to the universe, and as far as we know, there
        are neurons that are dedicated to creating this experience. It seems
        that we are correct in our thinking because we are able to manipulate
        the inputs to these neurons, even adjusting their function to our will,
        and it reflects our understanding of what reality is.
        
        This is the set of neurons that is involved in processing the inputs.

class MemoryNeuron(Neuron):
    ''' This is the set of neurons set deeper in the network that are involved
        in information storage. There is a temptation to define this set of
        neurons as an entity separate from other neurons with different roles,
        but a resistance to dichotomy serves well in the understanding of what
        makes a memory neuron what it is. It is a member of group, it plays to
        the tune of the resonant frequency of the greater whole. And the
        resonance is different depending on the memory it is a part of. 
        
        It comes to mind, that a Memory should be defined here since it is
        playing such a critical role in the definition, but memory is actually
        arising from the action of these basic building blocks and therefore is
        of higher order.

class MirrorNeuron(Neuron):
    ''' This is the set of neurons that provide an inner experience that 
        mirrors experience in the external world and do not differentiate 
        between the two.
